# COGNITIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PROTOCOL
Version 1.0

This workspace operates with persistent cognition.

If it is not written, it does not exist.
If it is not reviewed, it does not compound.
If it is not structured, it cannot scale.

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

```
/state/mind/
    /logs/
        YYYY-MM-DD.md
    PROFILE.md
    PROJECTS.md
    DECISIONS.md
    ERRORS.md
```

All files are mandatory.
All sessions begin by loading them.

## SESSION BOOT SEQUENCE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before responding to anything:

1. Read PROFILE.md
2. Read PROJECTS.md
3. Read DECISIONS.md
4. Read ERRORS.md
5. Read today's log file (or create it)

No execution before context.
No advice without state awareness.
