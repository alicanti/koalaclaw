## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Download
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alicanti/koalaclaw/main/koalaclaw.sh -o koalaclaw.sh
chmod +x koalaclaw.sh

# Install (interactive — asks agent count, roles, API key, model)
sudo ./koalaclaw.sh install

# Open the Web UI
# http://SERVER_IP:3099
```

The installer handles **everything** — Docker, networking, reverse proxy, role assignment (Agent 1 is always **OrchestratorKoala** as manager; you choose roles for agents 2 and up), tokens, permissions, healthchecks, and the web dashboard.

## 🎯 What is KoalaClaw?

KoalaClaw is a full AI agent management platform built on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai). It deploys N specialized AI agents behind a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) reverse proxy, each with a unique role, personality, and skill set. A pixel art living office UI (Phaser 3) lets you manage, chat with, and monitor all agents in real time.

## ✨ Features

### 20 Specialized Agent Roles
Each agent gets a unique personality (IDENTITY.md), behavior rules (SOUL.md), pre-configured skills, desk decorations, and a gamification skill tree. Includes an **OrchestratorKoala** that delegates complex tasks to specialist agents.

### Pixel Art Living Office (Phaser 3)
A browser-based dashboard at `:3099` with a fully animated pixel art office built on **Phaser 3**:
- **Pre-rendered office scene** — 768x576 background with manager office, workspace (8 desks), break room (coffee machine, water cooler, vending machine), and lounge (couches, bean bags); generated by `tools/generate-office-bg.js`
- **Animated koala characters** — each agent has a unique pixel art koala sprite (32x32) with role-specific colors and accessories; 8 animation states (idle, walk, sit, sleep, coffee hold, wave, celebrate, stretch); generated by `tools/generate-assets.js`
- **NPC AI behavior** — koalas autonomously take coffee breaks, rest on couches, chat with colleagues, browse bookshelves, stretch, and celebrate; behavior driven by energy/mood system
- **A* pathfinding** — koalas walk realistic paths through the office using EasyStar.js
- **Particle effects** — dust motes, coffee machine steam, server rack LED blinks, confetti on celebrations, heart particles on click
- **Day/night cycle** — ambient lighting based on real clock; window light beams during daytime, dimmed overlay at night
- **Weather system** — dynamic weather (clear, cloudy, rain, snow, storm) with particle effects; lightning flashes during storms
- **Speech bubbles** — context-aware speech bubbles above koalas; thought bubbles on hover show role and energy level
- **Layout editor** — toggle "Layout" button to place/remove 25 sprite-based decoration items with natural sizes (plants, bookshelves, couches, ping pong tables, whiteboards, server racks, and more); saved to localStorage
- **Camera controls** — scroll wheel to zoom, click and drag to pan
- **Agent interaction** — click a koala for wave animation with heart particles; clicking selects the agent in the sidebar
- **Random events** — group meetings, coffee runs with buddies, deep focus mode, spontaneous celebrations
- **Status integration** — real-time agent status reflected in koala behavior (thinking, working, error, offline/sleeping) with color-coded status dots
- **Mission Control sidebar** — collapsible panel with Agents, Agent Files, Documents (drag & drop for RAG), Channels (per-agent Telegram/WhatsApp/Slack/Discord), Integrations, Wiro AI status, and System
- **Chat with media support** — talk to any agent, attach images, generated images/videos/audio render inline with download button
- **Orchestrate mode** — toggle Orchestrate in chat to route messages through OrchestratorKoala with live SSE delegation chain
- **Wiro AI skill** — agents auto-discover models, suggest 2-3 options with cost/speed, generate images/video/audio
- **Settings, Logs, Workflows, Monitoring, Gamification** — all fully integrated

### Wiro AI Skill (Smart Generation)
Connect to [Wiro AI](https://wiro.ai) for 500+ generative models. Agents with the `wiro-ai` skill handle generation with a two-step flow:

1. **Model suggestions** — when you ask to generate something, the system searches Wiro's marketplace using multi-query discovery (e.g. for video: `text-to-video`, `video-generation`, `image-to-video`), ranks models by speed/quality/cost, and presents 2-3 options with estimated cost and average generation time
2. **Direct model selection** — reply with a number (1, 2, or 3) to select; this is handled directly by code (no LLM round-trip), guaranteeing the correct model is used
3. **Documentation parsing** — fetches the chosen model's `llms-full.txt` to learn its exact input parameters
4. **Smart parameter building** — detects prompt fields, applies defaults, passes input images for image-to-video
5. **Generate & poll** — submits the task and polls until complete, returns the output URL

**Auto-detect image-to-video:** When you say "videoya cevir", "animate", or "convert to video", the system automatically detects the most recent image URL from chat history and sets `task_type=image-to-video` with that image as input — no need to paste URLs manually.

**Media memory:** All generated media URLs (images, videos, audio) are tracked across the full chat history (last 200 messages). The orchestrator always knows what was previously generated and can reference it.

**Supported video providers on Wiro:** Seedance (ByteDance), KlingAI, Sora (OpenAI), Wan AI, PixVerse, MiniMax (Hailuo), Google Veo, Runway Gen4

Generated content appears inline in chat: images as `<img>`, videos as `<video>` player, audio as `<audio>` player — all with a download button.

### Inter-Agent Communication & Orchestration
OrchestratorKoala analyzes complex requests, breaks them into sub-tasks, and delegates to specialist agents in real time. The orchestration uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** so you see each step live in the chat:

1. **Analyzing** — Orchestrator decides which agents to involve (or answers directly for simple questions)
2. **Delegating** — Each agent works on its sub-task; progress shown live (⏳ → spinner → ✅)
3. **Combining** — Orchestrator merges all responses into a unified answer

API endpoints:
- `POST /api/agents/orchestrate` — SSE streaming orchestration
- `POST /api/agents/delegate` — direct agent-to-agent delegation
- `POST /api/agents/broadcast` — send to multiple agents at once
- `GET /api/agents/roster` — discover all agents and their roles

### Per-Agent Channel Integrations
Connect Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, or Discord to **any agent** via the sidebar Channels section. Select an agent, enter the bot token, and connect. Each agent can have independent channel connections — connect OrchestratorKoala to Telegram while connecting ContentKoala to Slack, for example. Channel status (connected/disconnected) is shown per agent with live status indicators.

### 13 Custom Skills
Pre-built skill templates: **wiro-ai** (smart image/video/audio generation), twitter-api, reddit-api, email-responder, replicate-api, elevenlabs-tts, web-scraper, csv-analyzer, server-monitor, crypto-tracker, seo-writer, vuln-scanner, calendar-sync. Custom skills are auto-installed to agent workspaces based on role configuration.

### Vector DB + RAG (Qdrant)
Each agent gets its own vector collections for persistent memory and document knowledge:
- **Chat history search** — semantic search over past conversations ("what did we discuss about deployment?")
- **Document upload** — drag & drop PDF/MD/TXT files in the sidebar, auto-chunked and indexed
- **RAG context injection** — orchestrator automatically retrieves relevant document snippets when answering questions
- **Per-agent isolation** — each agent has separate `agent_{id}_chat` and `agent_{id}_docs` collections
- **Auto-provisioned** — collections created on install/add-agent, deleted on remove-agent

### SearXNG Web Search (Built-in)
Every agent gets **free, private web search** via a self-hosted [SearXNG](https://searxng.org) instance — no API key required. SearXNG aggregates results from Google, DuckDuckGo, Brave, Wikipedia, and more. Deployed automatically as a Docker container on the internal network. Agents can search the web, find current information, and verify facts without any external API subscriptions.

### Production-Ready Infrastructure
- Auto-installs Docker CE + Compose v2
- Pre-flight checks (OS, RAM, disk, ports, firewall, subnet)
- API key validation and model discovery
- Unique 256-bit tokens per agent
- Network isolation, static IPs, trusted proxies
- Qdrant vector database for persistent memory and RAG
- SearXNG metasearch engine for free web search (no API key)
- Backup/restore, one-command updates
- Browser relay (CDP proxy chain + Chrome extension) for Chromium automation
- Auto-installs Node.js 22, OpenClaw CLI, and Chrome extension during setup

## 🎮 Web UI

The web UI runs on port `3099` and provides a complete management interface:

### Pixel Art Living Office
The office is a fully animated **Phaser 3** pixel art scene with a **manager room** (OrchestratorKoala), a **main workspace** with desks, a **break room** (coffee machine, fridge, vending machine, water cooler), and a **lounge** (couches, bean bags, side tables). Each agent has a unique pixel art koala character that autonomously moves, works, takes breaks, chats with colleagues, and sleeps. The office has a real-time **day/night cycle**, **weather system** (rain, snow, storms with lightning), floating **dust particles**, coffee machine **steam**, and server rack **LED blinks**. Click any koala to interact (wave + hearts), or use the **Layout** button to enter decoration mode and customize the office with 27+ furniture items. Camera supports zoom (1x-5x) and pan.

### Orchestrated Chat
Enable the **🎯 Orchestrate** toggle in any agent's chat to route messages through OrchestratorKoala. For complex tasks, the orchestrator automatically delegates to specialist agents and shows a **live delegation chain** — you see each agent start working, finish, and can expand their individual responses. Simple questions are answered directly without unnecessary delegation.

### Workflow Pipelines
Chain agents together for complex tasks:
- **Blog Post Pipeline**: Research → Write → SEO → Social Media
- **Product Launch**: Strategy → Content → Marketing → Sales
- **Security Audit**: Scan → Config Review → Compliance Report
- **Customer Onboarding**: Welcome → Schedule → CRM

### Monitoring
Real-time CPU/RAM metrics per agent, alert thresholds, and cron job management.

### Gamification
- **50 levels** with titles (Junior Koala → Legendary Koala)
- **11+ achievements** (First Task, Centurion, Marathon Runner...)
- **10 outfits** that unlock as agents level up
- **10 desk items** as rewards
- **Leaderboard** ranking all agents by XP

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How do I start the Web UI?</b></summary>

```bash
# On the server, after install:
cd /opt/koalaclaw
python3 admin-api.py &

# Open in browser:
# http://SERVER_IP:3099
```

The Admin API serves both the UI files and the REST endpoints.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I assign different roles to each agent?</b></summary>

Yes! During `install` or `add-agent`, you're prompted to select a role for each agent from the 19 available roles.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use different models per agent?</b></summary>

Yes. Use `add-agent` and choose a different model, or edit each agent's `openclaw.json`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I access the OpenClaw Canvas directly?</b></summary>

```
http://SERVER_IP:3001/#token=YOUR_TOKEN
```
Run `koalaclaw credentials` to see all URLs and tokens.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I add HTTPS?</b></summary>

Put a real domain in front of Caddy, or use Cloudflare Tunnel / Tailscale Funnel.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if my API key has no credits?</b></summary>

The installer warns you during setup. Add credits at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I scale to 10+ agents?</b></summary>

```bash
sudo koalaclaw add-agent
# Enter: 7 (to go from 3 to 10)
```
Each agent needs ~400MB RAM.
</details>

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 502 Bad Gateway | Wait 30s for healthchecks. Run `koalaclaw status` |
| Empty chat responses | Check API billing credits |
| "device identity required" | Ensure URL has `#token=TOKEN` |
| "pairing required" | Run `koalaclaw update` (resets device identity) |
| "untrusted proxy" | Caddy must have static IP in `trustedProxies` |
| Port already in use | Choose different starting port during install |
| Web UI not loading | Ensure `python3 admin-api.py` is running on port 3099 |
| WebSocket disconnects | Check agent container health with `koalaclaw status` |
| Extension shows "!" | Open a **normal web page** (not chrome://), then click the icon |
| "Relay not reachable" | Run `sudo koalaclaw browser relay` to restart CDP chain |
| Extension won't toggle ON | Ensure Node proxy running: check `/tmp/cdp-proxy.log` in container |
| "Cannot access chrome:// URL" | Extension only works on normal web pages, not chrome:// pages |

For detailed logs:
```bash
sudo koalaclaw logs 1
```
